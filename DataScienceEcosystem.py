# #### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python:

# In[2]:


# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5



# In[12]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
time_in_minutes = 200
time_in_hours = (time_in_minutes)/60
rounded = round(time_in_hours,2)
print(f"{rounded} hours")
